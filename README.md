# OODP MOBLIMA Design Project
 **Group members:** Shaun, Reuben, Chen Ning, John, Chuan Xin
 
 Object Oriented Design Programming Course Project for NTU REP Year 2, wherein we have to create a Movie Booking console application applying OODP principles.
 
## Contributing to the project

**READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.**

1. Ensure that you have fetched **AND** pulled the latest master branch into your local repository before making changes.
2. Make any changes to your local repository as required. **DO NOT DELETE, CUT OR COPY ANY FOLDERS/FILES.** You should only create new files.
3. Before you commit your changes, instead of commiting to the master branch, select **Current branch -> New branch**. When committing changes, **please check the changes list to ensure that the changes are correct.**
4. Push your commits to the new branch.
5. Submit a pull request to the master branch (it should pop up after you commit to the new branch).
6. After approval and review, your pull request will be accepted into the master branch.

## Important notes

- If it's your first time contributing, make sure to pull and fetch from the master branch before commiting anything.
- DO NOT pull from the master branch if you have changes on your local repository. All your changes will be lost. Instead, push all your changes to a new branch and submit a pull request.
- If you want to make further changes BEFORE the master branch is updated, make a new branch of your pending branch and work from there.
