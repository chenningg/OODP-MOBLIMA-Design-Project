# Contributing

Please follow the steps below in order to make a change to the master branch.

1. Ensure that you have fetched **AND** pulled the latest master branch into your local repository before making changes.
2. Make any changes to your local repository as required. **DO NOT DELETE, CUT OR COPY ANY FOLDERS/FILES.** You should only create new files.
3. Before you commit your changes, instead of commiting to the master branch, select **Current branch -> New branch**. When committing changes, **please check the changes list to ensure that the changes are correct.**
4. Push your commits to the new branch.
5. Submit a pull request to the master branch (it should pop up after you commit to the new branch).
6. After approval and review, your pull request will be accepted into the master branch.

## Important notes

- If it's your first time contributing, make sure to pull and fetch from the master branch before commiting anything.
